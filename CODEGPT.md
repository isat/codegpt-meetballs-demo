This project involves building a simple CRUD API using Node.js and Express, which stores data in-memory without relying on external databases. It is structured to demonstrate good practices in using Git for version control and collaboration. Each feature of the API—ranging from creating, reading, updating, to deleting data—is developed in separate branches and integrated via pull requests. The project emphasizes clear documentation, structured error handling, and basic validation to ensure data integrity. Key practices include descriptive branch naming, detailed pull request descriptions, and peer review requirements. This setup serves as a practical example for managing and reviewing code in a team environment using pull requests.
